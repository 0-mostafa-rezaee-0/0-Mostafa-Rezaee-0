**My brief CV**:    

- **Data Science Ph.D. Candidate**

- **Internship**: I did a summer internship at [Sanofi](https://www.sanofi.com/en/about-us), [Cambridge](https://jobs.sanofi.us/cambridgecrossing), MA, focusing on [Wearable Medical Devices](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/wearable-medical-devices-used-in-healthcare/). For my project, I developed a Python package to implement multiple algorithms and run diagnostics). Data preprocessing is also covered. 

- **SaveBirds.app**: www.SaveBirds.app is my Ph.D. project, a Data Science web application that helps manage 40,000 Protected Areas (PAs) across North America. SaveBirds fuels the [US$75 billion](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eesc/science/north-american-breeding-bird-survey#:~:text=common%20and%20helping-,fuel%20a%20%2475%20billion%20wildlife%20watching%20industry,-.%C2%A0%C2%A0Each%20year%20thousands) wildlife-watching industry indirectly.

- **Bird Atlas Generator**: Developed the first publicly available comprehensive [Bird Atlas Generator](https://savebirds.app/#navbarAtlasGenerator) of North American Breeding Bird Survey data which is available at SaveBirds.

- **Publications**: [30 Publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;gmla=AJsN-F4IU8kEHaoIXkdI8DCtulTjxG15pBj_W_YgkqjzSZ88SRWOdxlL4fdsg4SalnTvRjJwIXfiFZjdvk0sdHSxD-_3-dm2rQ&amp;user=jvcCIJYAAAAJ) including 9 Journal articles &amp; 21 full conference papers. Moreover, [6 under-preparation](https://savebirds.app/#navbarFuture) journal articles are outlined at SaveBirds. All the publications are computational studies using modeling and simulation approaches.

- **Recommendations**: Please see my LinkedIn [recommendations](https://mostafa-mr.com/#Recommendations).
